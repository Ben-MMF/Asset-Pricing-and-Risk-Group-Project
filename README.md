# Asset Pricing and Risk Group Project
This repository contains all the code for the Asset Pricing and Risk group assignment.

# Aims and Objectives
The aims of this project was to empirically compare performances of optimal portfolios based on sample estimates of mean returns and variance-covariance matrices, versus other strategies using different methodologies to tackle estimation errors. This is worked on under a Markowitz framework and theory.
We present the decrease in performance through cummulative and non-cummulative reutrns and investigate how different strategies, such as a shrinkage based and constrained portfolio, contrast to the classical Markowitz mean-variance portfolio. 
This project looks at out of sample performance obtaining results from a 60 month rolling window method, and uses the Kenneth R. French data library, more specifically 25 Developed Countries’ Portfolios formed on Size and Book-to-Market. It is important to note that this data is argued to be the explanation to why our results show a poor performance of the Naive (1/N) portfolio, whereas in much of the availible literature this is normally used as a portfolio that is aid to outperform many complex models.
